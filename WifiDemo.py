# Socket Demo  Open a UDP socket server on the local WiFi and accept messages there.
# This code runs in conjunction with an Android app built in MIT App Inventor.  The app has four pairs of buttons
# Basically, they are on/off buttons that send a string with three character ID and a 1 or zero for the desired state.
